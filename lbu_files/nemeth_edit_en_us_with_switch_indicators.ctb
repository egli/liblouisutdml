#Use it for EBAE literary texts surrounding Nemeth math blocks
#Typical usecase:
# mathtextTable en-us-g1.ctb or en-us-g2.ctb
# mathexprTable nemeth.ctb

#This table marks the beginning and end of math blocks with Nemeth switch indicators.
#The switch indicators help distinguish literary text from technical content.
#
#liblouisutdml inserts a space before and after each math block to separate it from the literary text.
#Such spaces are often undesirable, e.g., for punctuation and grouping symbols around the math blocks.
#In many cases these signs do not take their most appropriate forms as the math blocks
#are not yet present at the stage of literary Braille translation.
#This table makes a limited attempt to reconstruct the most likely form of some of the signs
#directly preceding or following a math block and to decide which of the automatically added spaces
#are to be kept or removed.
