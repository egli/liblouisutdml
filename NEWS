* Noteworthy changes in release 2.12.0 (2023-10-30)

This Liblouisutdml release brings major improvements to Nemeth Math
handling thanks to Attila Hammer and Norbert Markus. It also adds
support for liblouis 3.27.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouisutdml/milestone/8?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- Add support for liblouis 3.27
- Major upgrade to Nemeth Math handling thanks to Attila Hammer and
  Norbert Markus.
  - The order of some character definitions and include statements
    have been changed so that the now updated Nemeth Braille dot
    patterns of mathematical symbols take precedence over the literary
    Braille patterns for the same Unicode characters. E.g. the
    horizontal ellipsis, and division sign are among those affected.
  - Now the caret symbol appears with its intended Nemeth Braille dot
    pattern.
  - The colon and semicolon as mathematical symbols appear with a
    punctuation prefix (dots 456-25 and dots 456-23) and a space is
    added after them. The space may be skipped depending on the
    context.
  - A number of rules have been disabled to give way to the now
    updated Nemeth Braille dot patterns of mathematical symbols in
    ~nemethdefs.cti~.
  - The list of function names and abbreviations has been extended
    with items (e.g. two-letter abbreviations of function names and
    their combinations).
  - Indication of subscripts and superscripts has been improved and
    consolidated. E.g., numeric subscripts are now either indicated or
    not indicated by a subscript prefix as required. However,
    multilevel subscripts and superscripts are not (yet) covered as it
    requires keeping track of the current level.
  - A number sign is inserted before the first digit following a dot 5
    or dots 56 (also in combinations with a minus sign) if that prefix
    is the first cell in the block or after a space.
  - Now a single digit or letter with overbar is handled correctly.
    Previously a two-step rule had the side-effect of deleting dot 5
    from dots 5-13-156 even when this sequence appeared as part of
    signs of comparison (less than or equal to, etc). Now those signs
    of comparison, including those for sets are correctly displayed.
    The solution does not yet cover letters of another alphabet or
    type form. Such instances are displayed using the uncontracted
    five-step Nemeth rule.
  - Support for the contracted indication of a horizontal bar under a
    single digit or letter is added (dots 146-156 following the digit
    or letter) according to a 2013 BANA update to Nemeth Rule XIV.
    The solution does not yet cover letters of another alphabet or
    typeform. Such instances are displayed using the uncontracted
    five-step Nemeth rule.
  - Now a Nemeth rule for repeating decimals is observed. When a
    series of digits have each a dot above in print to mark a
    repeating period, it is sufficient to show a single dot in
    Braille. The modification block, however, applies to all the
    digits affected.
  - The decimal point now appears correctly (dots 46) even when
    preceding or following a dot five which indicates the beginning of
    a modification.
  - A space is inserted between the Braille representation of ~{}~ for
    the empty set.
  - The space is removed from between a grouping symbol and a
    horizontal ellipsis in various combinations.
  - The space between a function name/abbreviation and a superscript
    belonging to it is removed. In case of a log and colog, a
    subscript is expected. Note that the current solution is far from
    perfect as processing function names and their surroundings could
    better be done by an algorithm.
  - Any series of Multiple spaces in the math blocks are reduced to a
    single space at that place.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.11.0 (2022-03-08)

This minor Liblouisutdml release adds support for liblouis 3.20 and
up.

issues]].

** New features
- Add support for liblouis 3.20

  3.20.

** Regression in nemeth math
Note that there is a small regression when using Liblouisutdml
together with liblouis 3.20 that will case some of the nemeth tests
that include capital letters to fail. For details see
https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/1152. Hopefully this will
be resolved in the next liblouis release.
