The tests in this directory come from MathCAT (https://github.com/NSoiffer/MathCAT). Those tests were taken from the Nemeth "green book". That book has lots of examples which are divided up into "rules", where each rule might have several parts and each part might have several examples. The tests are numbered so that one can easily refer back to the green book. For example, "overbar_86_b_10" is a test involving overbars. That test is Rule 86, part b, example 10.
