INTRODUCTION

Liblouisutdml is an open-source library providing complete braille 
transcription services for xml, html and text documents. It translates 
into appropriate braille codes and formats according to its style sheet 
and the specifications in the document. A command-line program, file2brl 
which uses this library is also included. The latest version of liblouis 
is required. Java bindings are built in to the library.

INSTALLATION

First obtain the latest version of liblouis and compile it. Before
compiling, you should chose between 16- and 32-bit Unicode, as described
in the README file and the documentation. liblouisutdml inherits this
choice from liblouis.

After unpacking the distribution tarball for liblouisutdml go to the 
directory it creates. After running "configure" run "make" and "make 
install". You will need root privileges for the installation step.

This will produce the liblouisutdml library and the program file2brl . 
To compile the Java bindings go to the java subdirectory and run ant .

Note that that the library and programs will not work properly unless
you have first installed the latest version of liblouis.
